        <h2 class="menu-title">Chicken</h2>
        <p class="menu-content">Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
        <h2 class="menu-title">Beef</h2>
        <p class="menu-content">Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.</p>

        <h2 class="menu-title">Sushi</h2>
        <p class="menu-content">Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.</p>
